Learn how to implement localization in Laravel 11! üåê
In this tutorial, I'll walk you through step-by-step on how to switch languages dynamically in a Laravel app using cookies for persisting user preferences.

üëáüîä Important thing to understand:

Cookies vs. Database:
- Cookies are lightweight and store the preference directly in the browser. They‚Äôre ideal for users who aren‚Äôt logged in.
- Database is persistent and user-specific, making it suitable for logged-in users.

We'll cover middleware setup, route creation, controller logic, and language files, ensuring a seamless multilingual user experience. 

Perfect for beginners and pros alike looking to add localization to their web applications! üöÄrials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
